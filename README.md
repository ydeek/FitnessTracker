Track your workouts with Fitness Tracker. The app will keep track of every exercise in your workout. The app dashboard will display weekly summary graphs of all workouts done in a week.


# User Story 

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
